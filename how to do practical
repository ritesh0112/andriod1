Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to execute and understand the provided Android program:

Set up your development environment:

Make sure you have Android Studio installed on your computer.
Create a new project or open an existing project in Android Studio.
Create a new Android project:

Open Android Studio.
Click on "Start a new Android Studio project" or go to File -> New -> New Project.
Follow the steps in the wizard to create a new project. You can name your project whatever you like.
Make sure to select "Empty Activity" when prompted for the activity template.
Replace the contents of MainActivity.java:

Inside your project, locate the MainActivity.java file.
Replace the contents of MainActivity.java with the code you provided.
Understand the code:

The MainActivity class extends AppCompatActivity, which is a base class for activities in Android.
There are overridden lifecycle methods such as onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy().
Inside each lifecycle method, there's a log message indicating which lifecycle event is being executed.
Additionally, there's a Toast message displayed in the onCreate() method, which will show a short message at the bottom of the screen.
Run the application:

Connect your Android device to your computer, or use an emulator provided by Android Studio.
Click on the green "play" button in Android Studio to run the application.
Android Studio will compile your code and install the app on the selected device.
Once installed, you'll see the app running on your device/emulator.
Observe the lifecycle events:

Open Logcat in Android Studio (usually located at the bottom).
Filter the logs by your application's package name or by "Events" tag.
As you interact with the app (e.g., launching it, switching between apps, closing it), observe how the lifecycle events are triggered and logged in the Logcat.
Understand the lifecycle flow:

Observe the sequence of lifecycle events as you interact with the app.
You'll notice that each lifecycle event corresponds to a certain state of the activity, such as creation, start, resume, pause, stop, and destroy.
By following these steps, you should be able to execute the provided Android program and gain a better understanding of the activity lifecycle in Android.
